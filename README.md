**Chrisdiplacido/Chrisdiplacido** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

-  took some codine classes in elementary school/middle school.
-  Want to learn how to code/more about computer science, very helpful in most majors I'm looking at.
-  Interested in business and data analytics, looking to do something like that in college.
-  Looking to advance my knowledge in computer science, and become more knowledgeable about it.
